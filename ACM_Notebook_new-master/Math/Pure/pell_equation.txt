Consider equation: x*x - n*y*y = 1
Notice that for any solution (x, y), x/y is good approximation of sqrt(n).
In fact, fundamental (which min. x) satisfies:
(x,y) = (hi, ki) where hi/ki is the sequence of convergents to continued fraction for sqrt(n).
From fundamental solution, all solutions can be found using:
x(k+1) = x1*xk + n*y1*yk
y(k+1) = x1*yk + y1*xk
