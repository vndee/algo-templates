If g and f are arithmetic functions satisfying:
    g(n) = sum( f(d) for d|n )
then
    f(n) = sum( mu(d)*g(n/d) for d|n )

where mu(n) is:
    0 if n has squared prime factor
    1 if n is square-free and has even number of prime factor
    -1 if n is square-free and has odd number of prime factor

Generalized version:
    g(n) = sum( f(n div m) for 1 <= m <= n)
then
    f(n) = sum( mu(m) * g(n div m) for 1 <= m <= n)
